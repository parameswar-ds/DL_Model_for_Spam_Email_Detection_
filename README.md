Author: Parameswara rao

Date: 5 April 2020

I implimented model bu using spam_or_not_spam.csv data set to detect spam emails. This project is organised as follows:

(a) Extract data from data set.
(b) preprocess the data and split into train and test data for given model.
(c) Impliment Dence NN.
(d) Avoid overfitting by using different techniques.
(e) evaluate model using test data.

spam_or_not_spam.csv: data set for given model.

Result:
test_losss: 0.11950493179261684.
test_accuracy: 0.9639999866485596.
